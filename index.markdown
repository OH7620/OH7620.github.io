San Francisco is infamous for its crime levels. Particularly homelessness, prostitution and drug crime are of a first order concern for potential visitors. And perhaps rightly so. Particularly the central district of Tenderloin has historically been a hotspot for crime. Known in popular culture as well as from statistics as a high-crime neighborhood, this is indeed a picture that can be confirmed from the San Francisco crime statistics. 

Tenderloin has a long and colorful history as a home of city's biggest theaters, museums and nightlife. According to Ken Miguel ad Phil Matier (2022) Tenderloin was designed as a containment zone for crimes more than a hundred years ago. It was all about offering a affordable housing containing mainly small apartments for the ones that don't quite fit into the society. As a result, many bars, restaurants and even brothels moved to the area where the demand was high. As a result, it is one of the city's worse neighborhoods for crime and drug dealing. 

Therefore, it is no surprise that, Tenderloin is simultaneously the police district of San Francisco where drug crime is the highest relative to other police districts. In Tenderloin more types of crime are relatively more prevalent than overall in San Francisco. This goes for disorderly conduct, trespassing and particularly crime relating to drugs and narcotics. This is clearly revealed from the figures below:

But what is actually going on in Tenderloin? And where are typical spots? The heatmap below illustrates where drug/narcotics crimes by year are located in Tenderloin by day of the month aggregated for the years from 2003 to and including 2017. The heatmap may not show us a lot on the timely patterns, but is does hightlight where the crimes is going on in the Tenderloin. In the map we pinpoint two spots, a smoke shop where articles for the consumption of drugs are sold as well as a community center which is a center for overdose avoidance. There is naturally an immediate paradox in the fact these two spots are within a block from each other. Simultaneously, these places are hotspots for drug related criminal activities.

Looking at the hourly patterns, people tend to use most marijuana during the late afternoon and early evening.

The attached graph illustrates the distribution of the five most common types of drug crimes within 24 hours. It is easy to notice that the different types of drug crimes follow mainly the same circadian rhythm. The amount of crimes dives during the morning between 5-6 and increases towards the evening. However, there are small differences between the different types of drug crimes and we definitely want to delve deeper into these differences.

We see that crimes related to possession of narcotics paraphernalia which includes items used for controlled substances other than marijuana peak between 12-13 pm which seems quite interesting. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that most of the people who do drugs tend not to go to work which means they have time to do drugs also during traditional work hours. Remembering the reputation of the residential area, the result is perhaps not as surprising as it might seem at first. 

The selling of base/rock cocaine seems to be highest during the afternoon hours. We are also able to see some increase in the selling and possession volume during the last hours of the day. While potentially many explanations for this, most of them surely relate to the social characteristics of the neighborhood. Not only does Tenderloin seem to be a place where a lot of drug addicts reside, the most the common types of crimes (selling drugs and paraphernalia) also suggest that Tenderloin is a place to go from other parts of the city to buy drugs and appliances.

Possession of marijuana is also one of the most common types of drug crimes occurring in the Tenderloin. According to the graph, people tend to use most marijuana during the late afternoon and early evening. Considering the reputation of Tenderloin, one could assume that buying marijuana from the area is easy, so the amounts used are also high.


Tenderloin is undeniably one of the epicenters of San Francisco's drug crimes and this causes numerous adverse effects on the residents and companies in the area. The city has recently strived to stop the open air drug market in Tenderloin. However, the problems are so serious, that tackling them will require long-term actions from the city and requires investments from the goverment. In addition, cleaning the reputation of residental area takes time. The future will show whether the city manages to get the situation under control.
