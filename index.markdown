BACKGROUND

Tenderloin has a long and colorful history as a home of city's biggest theaters, museums and nightlife. According to Ken Miguel ad Phil Matier (2022) Tenderloin was designed as a contaiment zone for crimes more than a hundred years ago. It was all about offering a affordable housing containing mainly small apartments for the ones that don't quite fit into the society. As a result, many bars, restaurants and even brothels moved to the area where the demand was high.

COMMENTS ON THE GRAPH

The attached graph illustrates the distribution of the five most common types of drug crimes within a 24 hours. It is easy to notice that the different types of drug crimes follow mainly the same circadian rhytm. The amount of crimes dives during the morning between 5-6 and increases towards evening. 
However, there are small differences between the different types and we definetly want to delve deeper into these differences.
