San Francisco is infamous for its crime levels. Particularly homelessness, prostitution and drug crime are of a first order concern for potential visitors. And perhaps rightly so. Particularly the central district of Tenderloin has historically been a hotspot for crime. Known in popular culture as well as from statistics as a high-crime neighborhood, this is indeed a picture that can be confirmed from the San Francisco crime statistics. 

Tenderloin has a long and colorful history as a home of city's biggest theaters, museums and nightlife. According to Ken Miguel ad Phil Matier (2022) Tenderloin was designed as a containment zone for crimes more than a hundred years ago. It was all about offering a affordable housing containing mainly small apartments for the ones that don't quite fit into the society. As a result, many bars, restaurants and even brothels moved to the area where the demand was high. As a result, it is one of the city's worse neighborhoods for crime and drug dealing. 

Therefore, it is no surprise that, Tenderloin is simultaneously the police district of San Francisco where drug crime is the highest relative to other police districts. In Tenderloin more types of crime are relatively more prevalent than overall in San Francisco. This goes for disorderly conduct, trespassing and particularly crime relating to drugs and narcotics. This is clearly revealed from the figures below:

But what is actually going on in Tenderloin? And where are typical spots? The heatmap below illustrates where drug/narcotics crimes by year are located in Tenderloin by day of the month aggregated for the years from 2003 to and including 2017. The heatmap may not show us a lot on the timely patterns, but is does hightlight where the crimes is going on in the Tenderloin. In the map we pinpoint two spots, a smoke shop where articles for the consumption of drugs are sold as well as a community center which is a center for overdose avoidance. There is naturally an immediate paradox in the fact these two spots are within a block from each other. Simultaneously, these places are hotspots for drug related criminal activities.

The attached graph illustrates the distribution of the five most common types of drug crimes within a 24 hours. It is easy to notice that the different types of drug crimes follow mainly the same circadian rhytm. The amount of crimes dives during the morning between 5-6 and increases towards evening. However, there are small differences between the different types of drug crimes and we definetly want to delve deeper into these differences.

We see that crimes related to possession of narcotics paraphernalia peaks between 12pm-13pm which seems quite interesting. Drug paraphernalia includes items used for controlled substances other than marijuana. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that most of people who do drugs tend not to go to work which means they have time to do drugs also during traditional work hours. Remembering the reputation of the residental area, the result is perhaps not as suprising as it might seem at first.
